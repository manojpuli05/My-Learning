Today, I focused on covering the core foundational concepts of JavaScript, including variables, data types, loops, arrays, and the differences between == and ===. 
I explored what an array is and the different types of arrays in JavaScript. I also discovered that there are around 30 array methods in total. So far, I have learned and practiced 10 key array methods,
out of which I implemented 7 methods with practical examples. Additionally, I created a GitHub account to start maintaining and sharing my learning progress. For these major basic concepts, I also referred to 
basic JavaScript interview questions, specifically targeting variables, data types, loops, and arrays. I found around 15 theory-based questions for basic to intermediate levels, and approximately 20 questions 
at the advanced level. Although I havenâ€™t yet documented them in my notes, I have thoroughly reviewed each of these concepts to strengthen my understanding.
